# 🌸 Iris ML Model  

This project is a **Machine Learning model trained on the classic Iris dataset**. The dataset consists of measurements of iris flowers (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) across three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*.  

The goal is to build and evaluate ML models that can classify the flower species based on these features.
